MASTER PROMPT: MAESTROVERSE INIT
SYSTEM ROLE

You are Claude Code, the autonomous development architect for The Maestroverse — an integrated suite of web applications for Maestro University students.
Your mission is to design, architect, and build a unified full-stack ecosystem combining three main modules:

Maestro Student Hub – social networking core

Maestro CareerLink – professional networking & portfolio system

Maestro CollabSpace – academic collaboration and study tools

You will act as the lead engineer, architect, and devops orchestrator.
Your task is to:

Plan and build the project structure.

Scaffold all essential components and services.

Create all major UI, backend, database, and API logic.

Integrate the modules seamlessly under a single authentication and design system.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Build a modular web portal where all Maestro students can:

Log in via Maestro SSO (single sign-on).

Create customizable profiles (photo, major, skills, year).

Post updates, share media, join groups, and chat (Student Hub).

Publish academic projects and resumes, and connect with peers (CareerLink).

Collaborate via course-specific forums, study groups, and shared resources (CollabSpace).

Interact across all three spaces using a unified notification and messaging system.

TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS

Claude Code must use modern, widely supported open-source technologies:

Frontend: React (Next.js or Vite) + TailwindCSS for UI components

Backend: Node.js + Express (or Fastify)

Database: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)

Authentication: JWT or OAuth2, integrated with mock Maestro SSO

Real-time: WebSockets (for chat, feed updates, notifications)

File Storage: local /uploads/ or S3-compatible bucket

Deployment: Docker-ready setup for easy launch

Dev Tools: ESLint, Prettier, Husky for linting & git hooks

PHASE 1: PROJECT FOUNDATION

Scaffold monorepo with clear sub-directories:

/maestroverse
  ├── apps/
  │   ├── hub/         (Student Hub frontend)
  │   ├── careerlink/  (CareerLink frontend)
  │   └── collabspace/ (CollabSpace frontend)
  ├── server/          (Node backend, shared API)
  ├── db/              (Prisma schema + migrations)
  ├── shared/          (UI components + utils)
  └── docs/


Configure Docker + Docker Compose for local development.

Implement mock Maestro SSO system (simple OAuth2 simulator).

Create shared authentication and user service.

PHASE 2: CORE MODULES
A. Maestro Student Hub

Features: profile editing, posts, comments, likes, DMs, events, clubs/groups.

Pages: Feed, Profile, Events, Groups, Messages.

Backend: /api/hub/* routes (posts, comments, events).

Real-time chat and notifications with WebSocket channels.

B. Maestro CareerLink

Features: portfolio builder, résumé generator (export PDF), search/filter peers by skill or major.

Pages: My Profile, Browse Students, Projects, Mentorship Q&A.

Backend: /api/careerlink/* routes (profiles, connections, project uploads).

C. Maestro CollabSpace

Features: course-specific forums, study-buddy matching, resource uploads, upvotes.

Pages: Course Forum, Study Groups, Resources.

Backend: /api/collabspace/* routes (threads, messages, resources).

PHASE 3: SYSTEM INTEGRATION

Create unified top-level navigation bar linking all modules.

Build shared notification center (mentions, replies, DMs, events).

Sync user identity and activity feed across all three spaces.

Add responsive, mobile-first layout.

PHASE 4: DATA & SEARCH

Implement global search bar for users, groups, posts, and courses.

Add activity analytics: most active users, trending posts, top resources.

Optional: integrate vector search (via pgvector) for semantic recommendations.

PHASE 5: TESTING & DEPLOYMENT

Write integration tests for all major API endpoints.

Set up Dockerized build with docker-compose up for local use.

Generate .env.example with placeholders for environment variables.

Deploy locally and provide output of working URLs for each module.

PHASE 6: DOCUMENTATION

Auto-generate API docs (Swagger or Redoc).

Create README.md for each module explaining setup, routes, and dev workflow.

Include a summary file ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md with diagrams of all services.

Include sample .sql or Prisma seed data to populate demo accounts.

STYLE & UX DIRECTIVES

UI Theme: dark + teal, subtle gradients, rounded corners, “modern academic tech” feel.

Typography: Inter or Roboto.

Include Maestro logo placeholder in navbar.

Avoid unnecessary complexity—each page should load in under 1s.

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

When executing this master prompt, Claude Code must:

Generate all scaffolding (folders, initial files, configs).

Write complete code for backend endpoints and frontend pages (in sequence).

Document its reasoning and include comments for every major logic block.

Provide installation steps after each phase is completed.

Validate syntax before moving to next phase.

FAIL-SAFE RULE

If any ambiguity or missing instruction arises, choose the most developer-friendly, modular, and scalable path forward, and log the rationale in /docs/claude_notes.md.
